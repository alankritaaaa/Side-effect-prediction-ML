ðŸ’Š AI-Driven Drug Side Effect Prediction & Smart Substitution Recommender

This project presents a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and recommend safer therapeutic alternatives using machine learning. Built as part of my Masterâ€™s thesis at Pondicherry University, it aims to improve drug safety and reduce harmful side effects in clinical settings.

Key Features
- Predicts drug risk scores using an FDA-weighted side effect severity system.
- Recommends safer substitutes within the same therapeutic class.
- Streamlit web app for interactive use â€” drug input, risk output, and substitute recommendations.
- Explainable AI: Feature importance is derived using interpretable ML techniques.

Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Streamlit for deployment
- Random Forest Regressor (best performing model with RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.81)

Model Performance
- RÂ² Score: 0.81
- RMSE: 3.2
- MAE: 2.4
- Feature Importance:  
  - SideEffectScore = 0.58  
  - Chemical Class = 0.18  
  - Action Class = 0.15

Dataset
- Sourced from Kaggle: Includes drug names, classes, side effects, and substitutes.
- Features: Action Class, Therapeutic Class, Habit Forming, Side Effect Severity.
- Weighted scores based on FDA classifications (e.g., heart attack = 10, rash = 4).

How It Works
1. Drug name is input via Streamlit UI.
2. Model outputs a risk score using learned pharmacological patterns.
3. The system retrieves and recommends lower-risk substitutes from the same category.
